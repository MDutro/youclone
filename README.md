# YouClone

A YouTube Clone in React

This is a clone of YouTube's basic functionality written in React. This app is not currently hosted anywhere - it was written to practice manipulating data from external APIs and sending data from child components upstream to the parent.

The basic layout comes from a tutorial and but I have made changes to it and have expanded functionality.

If you would like to use this app, please go sign up for a Youtube API key by following [the instructions here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started). Then, create a .env file in the app's route directory and add the line `KEY="your-api-key-here"`
